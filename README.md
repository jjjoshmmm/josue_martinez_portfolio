# josue_martinez_portfolio

I hope you enjoy going through the projects that I'm showcasing!

I organized my portfolio in the following way:

1.  Neural Networks and Deep Learning
  - CV_Classifier_fastai
    - We use fastai/pytorch to classify images
  - Autoencoder Denoiser and Anomaly Detection
    - We use tensorflow to explore different types of Autoencoders
2. Data Science
  - Python for Data Science
    - Educational Resources to explain data science concepts
3. Machine Learning
  - Clustering
    - We use scikit-learn to explore how to cluster a two moon dataset
